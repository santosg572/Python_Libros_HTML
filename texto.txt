In this paper, we propose, discuss, and illustrate a computationally feasible definition of chaos
which can be applied very generally to situations that are commonly encountered, including
attractors, repellers, and non-periodically forced systems. This definition is based on an entropy-
like quantity, which we call “expansion entropy,” and we define chaos as occurring when this quan-
tity is positive. We relate and compare expansion entropy to the well-known concept of topological
entropy to which it is equivalent under appropriate conditions. We also present example illustra-
tions, discuss computational implementations, and point out issues arising from attempts at giving
definitions of chaos that are not entropy-based.
